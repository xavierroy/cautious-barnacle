Documenting what has changed in a product is one of the major tasks for a technical writer. Given a product's release cadence, this could be a twice-a-year effort or a constant ever-present challenge in modern product development scenarios.

I've written release notes that spanned multiple PDFs owing to regulatory requirements and I've written release notes that wouldn't fall foul of Twitter's 240-character limit.

The takeaway from this article from [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com) is that understanding what goes into a changelog and what need not is key. And of course, who reads your changelog and what do they expect out of it is also paramount.

> “Although it’s not difficult to create changelog posts, not all product changes warrant one. In general, it should be limited to the updates that are valuable to most of your customers. ”
