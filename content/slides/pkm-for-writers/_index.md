As writers, we deal with **information** in every part of our day.

{{% note %}}

That knowledge can belong to:
- SMEs
- Other Employees
- Customers
- Teammates
- YOU too

And how many times did you find yourself searching for a key piece of information?

 
---

## Did you find it?

* ### if yes, **how**?
* ### if no, **why**?

{{% note %}}
Think about how you found it? Did you go back to any original source of information like mails/tickets/intranet pages?

If you were unable to find it, why was it?
Where did you go wrong?

{{% note %}}
We all possess pieces of information (big and small) that may or may not make sense at first. But once you start collecting them and process them to bring in some form of structure, then everything starts meshing together and becomes knowledge.

# Knowledge Management (KM)
 
---

>  Knowledge Management is the process of capturing, distributing, and effectively using knowledge.

---

## KM as a discipline

> Knowledge Management is the <u>discipline</u> of enabling individuals, teams and entire organizations to collectively and systematically capture, store, create, share and apply knowledge, to better achieve their objectives. 

<small>[Wikipedia entry on KM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knowledge_management)</small>

---

## Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

---

> Personal Knowledge Management is a <u>process</u> of collecting information that a person uses to <highlight>gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share</highlight> knowledge in their daily activities and  the way in which these processes <u>support work activities</u>. 

<small>[Wikipedia entry on PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)</small>

![](./images/growth.svg)

The principle is that you are **responsible** for your growth and learning.

{{% note %}}
PKM is a bottoms-up approach to knowledge management.

## what is TiddlyWiki?

TiddlyWiki is a powerful *non-linear* note-taking tool that helps you collect and structure any kind of information and work with it to get stuff done.

It is a wiki-in-a-page.

---


Think of TiddlyWiki as a file drawer of notecards. 


The notecards are called *tiddlers*. 


The notecards are linked with each other through wiki links.
