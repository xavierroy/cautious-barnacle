Hi and welcome. My name is <a href="http://xavierroy.com" rel="me">Xavier Roy</a> and Paper Arrow is my blog on user experience and user assistance.

When I wanted a name for the site that was about documentation and user experience, I thought of _PaperArrow_ where **paper** would stand for the documentation (manuals) and  **arrow** serves as a reference or signpost for help. Relating to the user experience side of business, the references are wireframes and prototyping for  **paper** and task flows, user journeys, and flowcharts for  **arrow**. And the domain name was available, which clinched the deal for me. :)
