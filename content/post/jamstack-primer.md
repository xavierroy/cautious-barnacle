This was a last minute talk that I put together as there was a slot on Day 2 that was free. So this talk was planned as a 15-20 min session to introduce the JAMstack architecture. 

I did not get a chance to present this as the slot was no longer available. As I felt it is a topic that people ought to know about, I am making it available for people to peruse. 

And these slides are an example of the JAMstack in action. :-) 

It took about an hour to put together this slide deck. And I will expand on this topic as another detailed presentation in the future.
