As part of my job, I also work with my colleagues to create videos. Writing a script for the video and the voiceover is a key requirement. I used to do this a lot in my first job but over the years, videos stopped being part of my deliverables.


In my current role, we are expected to work on videos a lot and a part of the team is tasked with doing videos as a full-time or part-time job. I'm involved in most of the work except the final production nowadays.


As a writer, I wanted to improve my scripting skills. Getting the right words and the right cadence to those words is something I want to improve upon. And one improves by practice alone.


So, I'm starting a podcast to serve as a testament to my learnings. Notes from the Quiver will add on topics in Paper Arrow and also expand upon them.


As a start, I made a trailer introducing the podcast and released it.
