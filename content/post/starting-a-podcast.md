As a writer, I wanted to improve my scripting skills for videos and voiceovers. Getting the right words and the right cadence for those words is something I want to improve upon. And one improves by practice alone.


So, I'm starting a podcast to serve as a testament to my learnings. **Notes from the Quiver** will add on to and at the same time, also expand upon ideas and thoughts covered in the blog.


As a start, I made a trailer introducing the podcast and released it yesterday.

Today, I've released the first episode, [chattering about chatbots](https://anchor.fm/notesfromthequiver/episodes/Chattering-about-Chatbots-efrt3g).

I am using [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm) to create the podcast currently as it offered the path of least resistance. I also see this as an opportunity to learn about the technical side of podcasting and maybe some tools on the way.
